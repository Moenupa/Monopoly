COMP3211 Software Engineering Course Project

## Hints of the project

- Please observe the [Monopolyu.iml](./Monopolyu.iml) for the dependencies of the project.
- As the user manual and the developer manual are rather short, they are merged into one single document [Manual](./doc/Manual/COMP3211_Course_Project_Manual.pdf) for simplicity.
- The demonstration of the software is uploaded to Youtube [link](https://youtu.be/19nLNAoPFTQ) or you can open the video within this copy [here](./doc/Demo/Monopoly%20Demonstration.mp4).
- A screenshot of test coverage is available in [test folder](./test/test_coverage.png), while you can manual run the tests with IntelliJ IDEA to generate the same result.
- API/Test revision is also included [here](./doc/Revision/COMP3211_Course_Project_Revision_Document.pdf).
